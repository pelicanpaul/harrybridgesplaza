        During his life, Harry Bridges was many things: merchant seaman, union organizer, founder and leader of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), San Francisco port commissioner, and president of the California Congress of Seniors.

        Born in Australia in 1901, Bridges left home at the age of fifteen for a life at sea. In 1920 he came ashore for good in San Francisco. There, he found that dockworkers like himself suffered deplorable conditions. They were selected like cattle in a daily “shape-up” where thousands of men gathered to beg the foremen for a job. The lucky few kicked back a portion of their pay for the opportunity to work. Men earned an average of only $10 per week for work that was exhausting and dangerous. Companies had no incentive to improve conditions when a man injured or killed on the job could be easily be replaced from the pool of desperate men waiting at the pierhead.

        Bridges joined the burgeoning labor movement that aimed at improving these conditions. For decades this movement had been steadily opposed by the shipping companies, well-funded industrial associations, even government troops acting as strike-breakers.But in May 1934, buttressed by Roosevelt’s New Deal and the recognition of the right of workers to join unions, the seamen and longshoreman joined together to go on strike to improve their working conditions.. After eighty-three days of bloody conflict in ports up and down the west coast, agreements were reached for union recognition, wage increases,a union-controlled hiring hall, and coast-wide contracts that allowed dockworkers and seamen to finally work with dignity. Those agreements have lasted, in one form or the other, into the twenty-first century.
